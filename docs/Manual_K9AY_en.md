After connecting the network, go to the web browser at `http://192.168.4.1/wifi`. A window with WI-FI settings will open. You must enter the name and password of your router network and click "Connect / Disconnect" button.

After that, at the page http://192.168.4.1/wifi you can see the IP address of the device in your WI-FI network. Now that the switch is connected to your network, you can disconnect from the K9AY_Loop_sn__ network. Further, to access the switch's web server, use the IP address issued by your WI-FI router.
